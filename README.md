- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @lnomkin
- I am a second year MPA student at SIPA studying urban and social policy and am currently interning at the Mayor's Office. I have experience in education, fundraising, and strategic planning and management for social services. Most recently, I worked as the Manager of Strategic Initiatives for Met Council's Food Program. I hope to improve the delivery of social services for city government. 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in using data to drive forward social service delivery and make the programs more equitable and efficient for the end-user.
